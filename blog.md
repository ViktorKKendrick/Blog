This is my first blog post!

Week One of Awesome Inc. BootCamp Fall 2021

This first week has definitely been a bit weird for me. I expected to start learning code itself and getting used to the way a certain language works or something along those lines. Instead we learned how to use GitHub and how to connect a repository from CodeAnywhere to GitHub to upload our work. We aswell made a blog, however strange it may be at first, it makes sense. The blog is a great way to keep an update with your current progress and projects.

One thing I am excited to learn more about is the projects in CodeAnywhere we will be doing, and just using CodeAnywhere in general. The reason being, I am more comfortable in an IDE such as CodeAnywhere. I am still not comfortable working with GitHub, but within the next 16 weeks of this bootcamp, I plan on being proficient in it. 

The rest of this blog for the next 16 weeks will be for presenting my progress with learning code and projects as I continue through the 16 weeks of the Bootcamp. I hope that when I look back to this post and later posts as time goes on, that I can see the change in knowledge that I have aquired.

### Blog Post

*Week Two*

* Week Two of the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp has been quite busy. During the week we learned about HTML/CSS/JavaScript and began to use them. We used what we learned to re-structure a webpage about bird watching. Although we learned all of this, there are a few things I wish I could do but currently am too inexperienced to do. For instance, I would like to make a game or something similar for everyone in the camp to play together with and enjoy. Currently I am working on something that I can't say just yet because they might read this post aswell and I want it to be a surprise. I will slowly be adding to the secret project the more I learn throughout the coming weeks.

* I am currently not stuggling with anything. Although I've had some minor issues, like not being able to load up a container in CodeAnywhere, all of them have been solved and I am still working through without issues.

* When solving a problem, if I have time, I try every solution I can think of that involves the problem. If I end up not having the time, I reach out to someone more experienced than me to help me out. Most of the problems I have can be solved very easily, so I don't try and bother others with simple issue.
