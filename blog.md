This is my first blog post!

Week One of Awesome Inc. BootCamp Fall 2021

This first week has definitely been a bit weird for me. I expected to start learning code itself and getting used to the way a certain language works or something along those lines. Instead we learned how to use GitHub and how to connect a repository from CodeAnywhere to GitHub to upload our work. We aswell made a blog, however strange it may be at first, it makes sense. The blog is a great way to keep an update with your current progress and projects.

One thing I am excited to learn more about is the projects in CodeAnywhere we will be doing, and just using CodeAnywhere in general. The reason being, I am more comfortable in an IDE such as CodeAnywhere. I am still not comfortable working with GitHub, but within the next 16 weeks of this bootcamp, I plan on being proficient in it. 

The rest of this blog for the next 16 weeks will be for presenting my progress with learning code and projects as I continue through the 16 weeks of the Bootcamp. I hope that when I look back to this post and later posts as time goes on, that I can see the change in knowledge that I have aquired.

### Blog Post

*Week Two*

* Week Two of the Awesome Inc. Bootcamp has been quite busy. During the week we learned about HTML/CSS/JavaScript and began to use them. We used what we learned to re-structure a webpage about bird watching. Although we learned all of this, there are a few things I wish I could do but currently am too inexperienced to do. For instance, I would like to make a game or something similar for everyone in the camp to play together with and enjoy. Currently I am working on something that I can't say just yet because they might read this post aswell and I want it to be a surprise. I will slowly be adding to the secret project the more I learn throughout the coming weeks.

* I am currently not stuggling with anything. Although I've had some minor issues, like not being able to load up a container in CodeAnywhere, all of them have been solved and I am still working through without issues.

* When solving a problem, if I have time, I try every solution I can think of that involves the problem. If I end up not having the time, I reach out to someone more experienced than me to help me out. Most of the problems I have can be solved very easily, so I don't try and bother others with simple issue.

### Blog Post #3: It's Lasagna Time!
###Week three
This week we worked on making a Silly Story generator, which takes parts of an array of Strings, and replaces them in a story. This makes the program generate an almost random story of different characters, places, and activities.
Later, we then made an Alarm Clock. My clock was Garfield themed which included a background image of _The Garfield Show_ as well as the alarm sound was the opening intro of the old cartoon.
It was interesting to say the least.

It's about time to answer this week's questions:
* What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

I think the roles of the three work really well together, the HTML creates the template, the CSS polishes the template, and the JavaScript makes the template work.
* What are some objects that your blog incorporates?

This blog incorporates Headers both as a main title, and as subtitles. As well as paragraphs to describe what happened throughout the week and my
experiences.
* What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?

Pseudocode is an excellent way of transforming thoughts into coding. This reminds me a lot of how someone native to America might use images and
gestures to try and communicate with other cultures. Pseudo coding is pretty much writing your thoughts down step by step in english, and slowly
transforming that into code by using similarities. As an example: IF you need to go up and elevator, THEN press the up button. You take similar words
from the english and programming language to kinda template how you need to code. Personally I don't use pseudocode on projects that are really
straightforward such as a program that takes two numbers and multiplies it. As for projects that might take some time to process, such as the Alarm
Clock project, then pseudocode makes the entire thing so much easier. It is very similar to taking a study guide for a test, and then the test has the 
same questions, except maybe different numbers. Pseudo coding is the template for a straightforward coding experience.
